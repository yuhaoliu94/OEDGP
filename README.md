There are three examples in the notebook folder.

The case 1 shows a toy example with two-layer DGP, where the diagram is as follows:

The case 2 shows an example with three-layer feed-forward DGP, where the diagram is as follows:

The case 3 shows an example with three-layer DGP without feed-forward, where the diagram is as follows:

The case 4 shows a toy example with two-layer DGP for binary classification, where we treat the softmax as a layer as well:
